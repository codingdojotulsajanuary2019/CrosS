Runtime error, cryptography error due to not having my database forward engineered into my MyDatabaseServer.

same error is thrown when the username isnt exactly the same, like if you make the beginning of the username capitalized when its not supposed to be for example.

if you make the name of pretty much anything not exactly the same in everyy single way, aside from usernames and passwords you will get a name error for a variable.

putting a soace at the beginning or end of the charset will cause an attribute error.
