The pip install Django==1.11.9 command installed Django version 1.11.9 in the myenvironment once i had it activated.
After Django was installed I used the pip list command to list out the etire directory contents once it was activated.
Once not activated I used the pip3 command and it listed the things that were active, so nothing that I had just installed in Django while the environment was active.
The deactivate command deactivated my environment after I was done installing Django.
After I ran the install command again after it was already installed the terminal returned the following: Collecting Django==1.11.9

Successfully installed Django-1.11.9 pytz-2018.9
So it just downloaded the same files I already had, without duplication,
using pip freeze it only showed me my django and my pytz nothing else.
uninstall obviously uninstalls django if I ask it to. 
show django gives me all of the advanced information about django.
pip search flask searches my activated environment for any Flask information or files.
